## Features

- üîç Automated subdomain enumeration
- üõ°Ô∏è SQL Injection (SQLi) detection
- üîê Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability scanning
- üìÅ Local File Inclusion (LFI) testing
- üìä Multiple output formats (TXT, JSON, HTML)
- üéØ Custom payload wordlist support

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imadch7/BeHunt.git

```
usage: Behunt [options]

options:
  -u URL, --url URL     Target HOST/URL
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST
                        Payload wordlist
  -O {json,html,txt}, --output {json,html,txt}
                        Output format:
                         1. txt

  -E, --Enum            Enumerate all the subdomains of the URL
  -T {1,2,3}, --Tuning {1,2,3}
                        Tuning options:
                        [1]. LFI injection
                        [2]. SQLi (SQL injection)
                        [3]. XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
```

## Examples

### Basic vulnerability scan
```bash
Behunt -u https://example.com
```

### Subdomain enumeration
```bash
Behunt -u https://example.com -E
```

### SQL Injection testing with custom wordlist
```bash
Behunt -u https://example.com -T 2 -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### XSS scan with JSON output
```bash
Behunt -u https://example.com -T 3 -O json
```
