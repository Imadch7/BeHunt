-Sign in page

This page serves as a testing ground for the BeHunt app, it help improve the apps offence capabilities.

The sign in page was found in this website: https://colorlib.com/wp/html5-and-css3-login-forms/

The original code for the sign up page is here: https://github.com/puikinsh/login-forms/tree/main/forms/glassmorphism

The page in question is called Neumorphism Login Form.


-Django Server

The server accepts user email and password from the frontend and inserts it into a PostgreSQL database.

Added Django password hashing, which saves a hashed password in PostgreSQL, rather than the raw password text.

Changed the signup URL.

Added submit_login() function.
